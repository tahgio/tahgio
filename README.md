### About Me! :man_astronaut:
I'm a Front-end engineer, with some deep knowledge on graphic design! :man_juggling: After acquiring a master in Communication Design, I realized how ambitious is the task to fully understand something. :monocle_face: Since I am truly passionate about web development and also an ambitious person, my aspiration is the get something close to fully understanding how web development works. I'm not sastified with just knwoledge on Front-end and UX/UI Design, I want to get to know the back-end so I can be a Full-stack Engineer. :mage_man: 

### Fluency
>Here is some of the languages and softwares that I've learned to use for programming and some others that I'm still learning. If a tag is on the  Proficient list it means that I had done at least one big project with it. The learning list means that I'm not confident to say I know it, even though I had used it in a course or a small project.
